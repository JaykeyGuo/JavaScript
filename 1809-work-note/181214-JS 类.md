### JS 类

```js
class HospitalEmployee {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
  }
  
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get remainingVacationDays() {
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  
  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
  }
  static generatePassword () {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)
  }
}

class Nurse extends HospitalEmployee {
  constructor(name, certifications) {
    super(name);
    this._certifications = certifications;
  } 
  
  get certifications() {
    return this._certifications;
  }
  
  addCertification(newCertification) {
    this.certifications.push(newCertification);
  }
}

const nurseOlynyk = new Nurse('Olynyk', ['Trauma','Pediatrics']);
nurseOlynyk.takeVacationDays(5);
console.log(nurseOlynyk.remainingVacationDays);
nurseOlynyk.addCertification('Genetics');
console.log(nurseOlynyk.certifications);
```

### Review: Classes

Way to go! Let's review what you learned.

- Classes are templates for objects.
- JavaScript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.
- Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.
- We use the extends key word to create a subclass.
- The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.
- Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.

In completing this lesson, you've taken one step closer to writing efficient, production-level JavaScript. Good luck as you continue to develop your skills and move into intermediate-level concepts.
